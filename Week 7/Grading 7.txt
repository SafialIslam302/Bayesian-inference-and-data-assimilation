Ex1: 8/10 - Convergence to its stationary distribution needs some more conditions and can be shown theoretically in this case

Ex2: (i) error in the implementation, the plots do not look right
(ii) The task is to describe the behaviour of x(t) depending of f(x(t))
(iii)don't know what is happening here
(iv) yes

3/10

Ex3: (i) the distribution of x_2 is not right
